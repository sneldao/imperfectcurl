// Placeholder for Staking for Boosts Smart Contract on Algorand
// This TEAL code will be developed to handle staking of Algorand tokens or NFTs for in-game boosts
// Logic will include:
// - Allowing users to stake tokens or NFTs
// - Managing temporary boosts (e.g., increased hint frequency, bonus points)
// - Returning staked assets after a defined period or upon user request
// - Ensuring transparency and security through smart contract logic

#pragma version 8

// Add actual TEAL code here once development environment is set up
