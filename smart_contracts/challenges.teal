// Placeholder for Smart Contract-Based Challenges on Algorand
// This TEAL code will be developed to handle time-bound fitness challenges
// Logic will include:
// - Setting challenge parameters (start time, end time, required reps, accuracy threshold)
// - Verifying user performance data
// - Distributing NFT or token rewards upon successful completion

#pragma version 8

// Add actual TEAL code here once development environment is set up
