# ImperfectCurl

Welcome to **ImperfectCurl**, an innovative fitness app built on the Algorand blockchain that combines AI-powered form analysis with gamified workout challenges to enhance your bicep curl training. Track your progress, earn dynamic NFTs, compete on leaderboards, and engage with onchain features for a unique fitness experience.

## Overview

ImperfectCurl leverages computer vision and machine learning to analyze your bicep curl form in real-time, providing feedback to help you improve technique and prevent injury. The app gamifies your workout with mystery weight challenges, where you match an unknown weight through reps, unlocking hints as you progress. Integrated with Algorand, ImperfectCurl offers blockchain-based rewards and community features to keep you motivated.

## Current Features

- **AI-Powered Form Analysis**: Real-time feedback on your bicep curl technique using pose detection to ensure proper form and maximize workout effectiveness.
- **Gamified Challenges**: Engage in the Curl Balance Challenge, where you match a mystery object's weight within a 2-minute timer (starting after the first rep), with automatic hints unlocked at rep milestones (10, 20, 30, 40 reps).
- **Dynamic NFTs**: Earn NFTs that evolve based on your fitness progress, reflecting total reps, form score, and streak, recorded on the Algorand blockchain.
- **Leaderboard Competition**: Compete globally in categories like Most Accurate, Most Reps, Speed Demon, and Efficiency Master, with accuracy-focused scoring.
- **User Progression**: Difficulty scales with skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), ensuring challenges match your improvement.
- **Onchain Features**:
  - **Smart Contract-Based Challenges**: View and participate in time-bound fitness challenges (mock data currently) to earn special NFTs or tokens.
  - **Staking for Boosts**: Stake Algorand tokens or NFTs (mock data currently) for temporary in-game boosts like increased hint frequency or bonus points.

## Planned Features

We're continuously evolving ImperfectCurl to bring more value to our users through blockchain integration and enhanced fitness tracking. Upcoming features include:

- **Full Smart Contract Integration**: Develop and deploy Algorand smart contracts for challenges and staking, replacing mock data with real blockchain interactions using TEAL or PyTeal.
- **Tokenized Leaderboard Rewards**: Offer tokenized rewards on Algorand for top leaderboard performers, incentivizing consistent participation.
- **NFT Trading and Gifting**: Enable a community marketplace within the app for trading or gifting NFTs on the Algorand blockchain.
- **Onchain Fitness Milestones**: Add more granular milestones for various fitness metrics, triggering unique NFT upgrades or token rewards.
- **Community Governance**: Issue governance tokens on Algorand for users to vote on game features, challenge themes, or reward structures, fostering community involvement.
- **Expanded Workout Analysis**: Extend AI analysis to other exercises beyond bicep curls, broadening the app's fitness scope.
